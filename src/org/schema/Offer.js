/**
 * Schema.org/Offer
 * An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service — for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book.\n\nNote: As the [[businessFunction]] property, which identifies the form of offer (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose), defaults to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell; an Offer without a defined businessFunction value can be assumed to be an offer to sell.\n\nFor [GTIN](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin)-related fields, see [Check Digit calculator](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/support/check_digit_calculator) and [validation guide](http://www.gs1us.org/resources/standards/gtin-validation-guide) from [GS1](http://www.gs1.org/).
